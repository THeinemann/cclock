# centhclock
Time measure divisible by 100, not 60


Why the heck is a minute 60 seconds? Why on earth is an hour 60 minutes? Wouldn't it make much more sense if a minute were 100 seconds, and an hour 100 minutes? Oh wait, how about a day being 100 hours?

Introducing centhclock: a time measure that turns time counting into something that *actually* makes sense.

A centhclock is composed by three basic time measures: centhconds, centhutes and centhours


Time measure | Centhconds | Centhutes | Centhours
---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------
1 Second | x centhconds | y centhutes | z centhours
1 Minute | x centhconds | y centhutes | z centhours
1 Hour | x centhconds | y centhutes | z centhours


For usage purposes, we can also think about each centhclock measure in terms of seconds, minutes and hours

Time measure | Seconds | Minutes | Hours
---------------------|--------------------------|----------------|------------
1 Centhcond | x seconds | y minutes | z hours
1 Centhute | x seconds | y minutes | z hours
1 Centhour | x seconds | y minutes | z hours
